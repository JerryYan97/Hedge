Milestone 1: (Done)
- Render HUD Entity: Two texts show player and oppoent scores. (Done)
- A Camera and a Cube with IBL. (Done)

* Implement UI entity and component (No Need, just PongGame hardcoded)
* Make custom ImGUI Rendering (Done)

Milestone 2:
- Revert Rendering to just diffuse. (Maybe Unnecessary -- Point light also looks ok)
- Render Two boards and a ball (In the middle -- an obj loader -- No Need. Just Blender output). (Done)
- Integrate Input Handler. Be able to customize input and control a board. 
- Basic final version HUD/interaction: Press ESC to leave, UP-DOWN to control board -- All rules texts.

Milestone 3:
- Spawn Two Boards and Ball through the MainGameEntity.
- Properly integrate PBR and IBL. (Normal, Occlusion, ..., maybe unnecessary, a pt light looks ok)
- Render the Top and Bottom Walls (With texture/normal... Maybe I can use the LearnOpenGL one)

Milestone 4:
- Simple physics to make ball bounces work
- Update UI score accordingly.
- Respawn ball in the middle after each turn. Ball init dir random.

Milestone 5:
- Simple AI opponent to follow the ball.
- Proper gameplay: Pop-up win/lose after 5-10 turns. Ask whether wants to continue.
- Video recording and publish on Itch.io

Milestone 6+:
- Music
- More interesting gameplay:
---- More fancy obstacles to make bounces more unpredictable.
---- Ball speed changes
---- Rotating Camera
---- Interesting Background Decoration <--> Football Gate.
- More Rendering Tech:
---- SSAO
---- Motion Blur
