We may want a dynamic shader-pipeline system.
The shader input can be dynamic
-- Whether it uses pure color or whether it uses IBL.
-- Whether it has point lights.

Now, in order to save development time, I just use a mono shader and feed dummy textures to the shader. Besides, this compromission won't affect future detailed design.

E.g. 
- Pure color textures to the base color textures.
- Pure blue textures to the normal textures.
- Pure black textures to the diffuse cubemap or prefilter environment cubemap textures.
- Pure white textures to the occlusion texture.
